Moissanite has a higher refractive index, which makes it more brilliant than diamond. The glow of moissanite is multi-colored and all colors of light can be seen with the naked eye.<\/p><p><strong>Hardness and durability<\/strong><\/p><p>Diamond is the hardest material on planet Earth with a hardness of 10 on the Mohs scale. Moissanite is the second hardest and the average hardness of each stone is 9.5 on the Mohs scale.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Both stones have very high scratch resistance and brittleness. It is almost impossible to break or scratch a moissanite or diamond. While zirconia loses its shine over time, moissanite and diamond remain shiny even after years of use, making them timeless.<\/p>",
